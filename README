# Hunting-Framework
This project is a python framework containing heuristics for hunting bad things in pcap.
It provides a .txt report for each pcap summarising the results and a score based on the level of malicous or suspicious traffic.

The framework makes use of the Virustotal Public API and therefore requires an API key.

Dependencies:
 - Python3
 - Tshark as an environment variable
 - requests module (installed via pip)

Output is placed in ./Output/

Main.py - This script takes a pcap as input and produces csv files and a temp file which is interpreted by heur.py.

Heur.py - This script takes no arguments as it reads from the tempfile outputted my Main. It contains the processing and heuristics classes and outputs a text report.

Usage: python3 Main.py pcap

Usage: python3 heur.py
